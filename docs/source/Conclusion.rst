Summary of the results
-----------------------

Outlook for possible further developments
------------------------------------------
- Support for additional geospatial models.
- Enhanced interactivity for 3D visualizations.
- Integration with LiDAR data for precise elevation modeling.
- Started a segmentation model, to choose more balanced what the training and test data is, NRW does have a lot of fields and forest but the models don't need to be good at predicting those.
